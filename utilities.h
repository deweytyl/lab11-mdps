/*  Procedure
 *    calc_eu
 *
 *  Purpose
 *    Calculate the expected utility of a state and action in an MDP
 *
 *  Parameters
 *   p_mdp
 *   state
 *   utilities
 *   action
 *
 *  Produces
 *   eu
 *
 *  Preconditions
 *    p_mdp points to a valid mdp struc
 *    0 <= state < p_mdp->numStates
 *    utilities points to a valid array of length p_mdp->numStates
 *
 *  Practica
 *    The following are not preconditions, per se, but lend themselves
 *    to meaningful results:
 *      p_mdp->terminal[state] = 0 (No meaningful actions in a terminal state)
 *      action belongs to the array p_mdp->actions[state]
 *
 *  Postconditions
 *    eu is the average utility of subsequent states that arise from taking the
 *    specified action in the given state:
 *       eu = sum_{s'=0..p_mdp->numStates} P(s'|state,action) * utilities(s')
 *    where P(s'|s,a) represents the transition probability in the MDP

 *
 *  Produces
 *   [Nothing.]

 *  Preconditions

 *    utilities points to a valid array of length p_mdp->numStates
 *    meu != NULL
 *    action != NULL
 *
 *  Postconditions
 *    *meu is the maximum expected utility of state in p_mdp:

 *    *action is a value of a that yields *meu: argmax_{a} EU(state,a)
